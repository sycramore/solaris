# The code generates a graph state based on an adjacency matrix and computes the stabilizers for that graph state.
# The adjacency matrix is a square matrix where a non-zero entry (i, j) indicates an edge between qubit i and qubit j.
# The graph state is generated using Hadamard gates and controlled-phase gates.
# The stabilizers are generated based on the adjacency matrix, where each stabilizer corresponds to a qubit in the graph state.
# The stabilizers are represented as strings of 'X', 'Z', and 'I' (identity) operators.

# The adjacency matrix can be modified to generate different graph states.
# The code uses the Qiskit library to create quantum circuits and manipulate qubits.
# The generated quantum circuit can be executed on a quantum simulator or a real quantum computer using Qiskit.
# The stabilizers can be used to analyze the properties of the graph state and perform measurements.
# The code is structured into functions for better organization and reusability.
# The main function serves as the entry point for the script, allowing for easy testing and execution.
# The adjacency matrix is defined as a NumPy array for efficient numerical operations.
# The code is compatible with Python 3 and requires the Qiskit library to be installed.
# The Qiskit library provides a comprehensive set of tools for quantum computing, including circuit creation, simulation, and execution.
# The code can be extended to include additional features, such as visualizing the quantum circuit or analyzing the stabilizers in more detail.
# The generated quantum circuit can be visualized using Qiskit's built-in visualization tools, such as the circuit drawer.
# The stabilizers can be analyzed to understand the symmetries and properties of the graph state.
# The code can be integrated into larger quantum computing projects or used as a standalone tool for generating and analyzing graph states.
